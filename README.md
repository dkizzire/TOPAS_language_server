# TOPAS Language Support for VS Code

This extension provides **syntax highlighting**, **language support**, and **basic features** for the TOPAS language, commonly used in crystallography and material science, directly within **Visual Studio Code**.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for `.inp`, `.out`, `.inc`, and `.str` files.
- **Highlighting support** for:
  - Keywords
  - Functions
  - Variables
  - Operators
  - Comments
  - Local Macros


## File Types Supported

- **.inp**: Input files for TOPAS
- **.out**: Output files generated by TOPAS
- **.inc**: Include files for additional macros
- **.str**: TOPAS structure files

## Future Updates - Works in Progress

- **Snippets:** insertable common code blocks for constructing TOPAS input files, similar to the old JEdit Xinsert plugin. 
- **Import CIF:** parse CIF files and format data for running in TOPAS
- **Send to TOPAS:** Launch TOPAS from VS Code and load active .inp file for refinement. 


## Installation

1. Download and install the extension from the **Visual Studio Code Marketplace**.
2. Once installed, the extension will automatically apply to `.inp`, `.out`, and `.inc` files.

## Usage

- **Comments**: Block and line comments are highlighted.
- **Keywords**: Common TOPAS control keywords are supported, such as `prm`, `local`, `global`, etc.
- **Functions**: Functions like `Abs`, `Sin`, `Cos`, etc., are highlighted.
- **Operators**: All mathematical and logical operators are supported.
- **Macros**: Macros defined with the `macro` keyword will be highlighted.
